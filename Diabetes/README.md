# ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on medical diagnostic data.  
The dataset used is the **PIMA Indians Diabetes Database**, containing **768 patient records** with **9 clinical features** such as glucose level, BMI, age, and insulin.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
- Implemented and compared **3 machine learning models**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).  
- Achieved **78% accuracy** with Logistic Regression (highest among tested models).  
- Preprocessed data by handling missing values, scaling features, and visualizing distributions.  
- Evaluated models with **confusion matrix, ROC curve, and probability density plots** for interpretability.
